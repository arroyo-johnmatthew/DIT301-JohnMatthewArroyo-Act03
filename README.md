[REFLECTION]
1. What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)
- I decided to place a light-blue background and a little bluish color on the text description box. This is to make the colors less
  known and give more attention to the username text box and the profile picture. For fonts, I used simple fonts like sans-serif to make the text simple but readable.
  For the layout, I tried to arrange them in a vertical manner given that there are only few contents to put in a single slide/frame.

2. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?
- I added a green color to the submit button to indicate this is a choice you must make before exiting the slide. I made sure the design is simple yet pleasing to look at
  that is why I added light blue color theme. I arranged all the components in a way that is straightforward to look at (TOP - BOTTOM).

3. What would you improve if this were a real app?
- I would add more components/features because this is less. I would make sure this is readable both in light and dark mode and make my slides more responsive in both portrait and landscape.
